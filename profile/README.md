# Empanacho Studio

An indie game development studio focus on storytelling. The main idea is to create
video games with a rich story of effed up characters and their journeys to become better version of themselves.

*NOTE* 
My solo adventure as an indie game developer. 
This, of course, like any experiment is doom to fail. However, I must try. I owe this to myself.

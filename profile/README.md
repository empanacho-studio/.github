# Empanacho Studio

An indie game development studio focus on storytelling.<br/>
The main idea is to create video games with philosophical stories<br/> 
of effed-up characters and their journeys to become<br/> 
better version of themselves.


**NOTE**<br/> 
My solo adventure as an indie game developer.<br/> 
This, of course, like any experiment is doom to fail.<br/>
However, I must try. I owe this to myself.
